# 🚗 Vehicle Price Prediction Web Application

This project is a Machine Learning based web application that predicts the price of a vehicle based on user input such as maker, model, year, engine size, mileage, fuel type, and transmission.

The application uses a trained machine learning model and a Flask web framework to provide real-time price predictions through a simple web interface.
