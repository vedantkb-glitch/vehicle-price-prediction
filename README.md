This is a Machine Learning based Vehicle Price Prediction web application built using Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn. The system predicts the estimated price of a vehicle based on inputs such as maker, model, year, engine size, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. A trained machine learning model is saved and loaded using a `.pkl` file, and predictions are displayed through a simple web interface. The project demonstrates the integration of machine learning with web development and is suitable for academic and learning purposes.
